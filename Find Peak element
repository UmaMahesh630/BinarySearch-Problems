Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.


public int GetPeakelement(int[] nums)
{
int left = nums[0];
int right = nums.Length-1;

while(left+1 < right)
{
  int mid = left+(right-left)/2;

  if(nums[mid]<nums[mid+1])
{
left = mid;
} else
right = mid;
}

return nums[left]>nums[right]?left:right;


}
